"""SQLAlchemy database setup.

A lightweight SQLite database is used so the service is self-contained and
requires no external database server. Each uploaded file is stored along with
its extracted features and computed measurements, so the heavy geospatial
processing happens once (during upload) and the read endpoints stay fast.
